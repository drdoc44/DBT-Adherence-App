        <p>"A DBT therapist, as an individual’s primary therapist, has the responsibility to organize each therapy session by treatment goals for that particular stage of therapy.
           Targeting in DBT refers to the therapists’ ability to organize each session by four classes of behaviors ordered by priority: Suicidal Behaviors,

        <br>
        <h3>Dialectical (reference Table 7.1)</h3>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Dialectical Thinking (reference Table 7.1)</h3>
        <p>"Therapist models dialectical thinking by searching for a synthesis, examining both sides of a position, ask “what is left out”.

        <br>
        <h3>V2- Validation Through Accurate Reflection (reference Table 8.1-8.3)</h3>
        <p>"Using a nonjudgmental stance, therapists summarizes what the patient is sharing with statements such as “Let me make sure I’m understanding you correctly, you said…”
          A therapist does not have to agree with the patient when reflecting but simply is attempting to demonstrate understanding."</p>

        <br>
