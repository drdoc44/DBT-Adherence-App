Steps to edit repo
0. Install git for your system
	-install url: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
	-configure your credentials
	-run command 'git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"'
	-run command 'git config --global user.email "<Your Email>"'

1. Clone repo from github into desired directory
	-use the url from the main github repo page under the green 'Code' button near the upper right
	-use command prompt to navigate to desired directory where you want project to be stored on your computer
	-run command 'git clone <URL>' w/o the braces. this will automatically clone all the code from that repo into the current directory
	-NOTE: you only ever need to do this at the beginning of a project.

2. Make changes needed to the files
	-this includes changing existing files, creating new ones, deleting existing ones, and changing the directory structure.

3. Add your changes to staging
	-Changing a file will mark it as tracked. Run command 'git status' to see what files were changed.
	-Run command 'git add --all' to have all the changes you made be marked as ready to be pushed.
	-alternatively, you can run 'git add <filename>' to add specific files and exclude others.
	-Run command 'git commit -m "<message>"' to commit your files to your local repository. message should be a brief summary about what change you made.

4. Push your code to Github
	-Run command 'git push' to push all committed changes to the GitHub branch. 
	-This will override the current branch we're working on and your changes will now appear on Github.

5. Updating your local files from Github
	-If a change was made to Github by someone else, the files you have on your computer won't match the Github anymore.
	-To solve this, run command 'git pull' in your local directory
	-This will automatically pull any new code down from Github. It will override any files you have, so be careful not to delete any changes you have pending.
	-It's recommended you run 'git pull' everytime you start working in case anything has changed.
