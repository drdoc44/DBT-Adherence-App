     <h4>Background</h4>
         <p> "Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a comprehensive, multi-modal treatment originally developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD).
            The multi-modal, multiple-component, and principle-based intervention can make it particularly challenging to learn how to effectively deliver DBT." </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p> "In order to facilitate the most effective delivery and training of DBT, Linehan created tables of checklist for the majority of the chapters in the core training manual for DBT (Linehan, 1993).
            By bringing attention to the ideas and principles underlying these checklists, a therapist can improve their ability to provide DBT by more closely following the expectations presented in the manual."</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p>"The intent of this application is to allow therapists to track their adherence to these principles underlying these checklists.
            The application allows for a therapist to view peer ratings along with self-ratings and track clients across time."<p>
